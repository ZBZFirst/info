    <h1>Research Publications</h1>
    <p>Publishing research is fucking hilarious. It's just doing a science report like in highschool but with Adults. My favorite part was Author listing and how much drama came around it. There was always an argument for every paper on the author listing. You could tell tempers flared once everyone left. That's also why Author Listing discussions happened at the end for my group. People got mad about their positioning and would leave the group. It is also a reason why I don't do group work anymore.</p>
    <p>I never received any payment for my research. All research was done on my own time off the company clock. As a result, many hours of Fatherhood were lost to these research endeavors. As a result, my honest opinions of them are below. Don't do research at Loma Linda University, you do it for free there.</p>

        <h2>The Effect of Biologic Therapy in Severe Asthmatics and ER Admissions During COVID-19: A Retrospective Study</h2>
        <p>I reviewed medical records for the team. Derrick came up with the idea, Christian participated, Abdullah wrote the paper, Noha did the Statistics Crunching, Dr. Tan was the MD on the Paper, I reviewed charts, No idea who Leeper Lan was. Abdullah commonly used randos to complete the parts of the research he didn't want to do. That's how I got in.</p>

        <h2>Post Bronchial Thermoplasty Discharge in Severe Asthmatics</h2>
        <p>Dr. Tan did a bunch of Thermoplasty, Abdullah wrote about it with Tan and got it published. I have no idea who Sandeep was, if he was that doctor I think it was, then I'm not sure what he did. I looked at all the pre and post scoring in the data and created a spreadhsheet for Abdullah to practice running statistics on. We didn't use Noha for this and he wanted to do it himeself.</p>

        <h2>Bronchial Thermoplasty in Severe Asthmatics: Pre and Post Anxiety Levels</h2>
        <p>This was the one that I suggested to Abdullah when I was looking at the charts from the other Thermoplassty article. While reviewing the charts, I noted the ACT Levels dropped across the board. We made a paper from this finding but this is where I learned Author Placement does not really matter.</p>

        <h2>Sleep Knowledge and Perception of Health Care Professional Students in a Faith Based Health Institution</h2>
        <p>This study made no sense. We just did it to submit to ATS, I got a student scholar award for it. Kind of like that time that I did model UN, I had no idea what I was doing but they gave me an award. I believe ATS Scholarship is the participation award for students in an M.S. Program. The truly weird part was Dinkfield's involvement, she was a journalism major who was Abdullahs barista from starbucks at the time.</p>

        <h2>Perceptions, Challenges, and Barriers on Establishing Advance Practice Respiratory Therapy in the State of California: A Needs Assessment Study</h2>
        <p>This was a really funny study. Yiqing is a affiliated member of the Communist Party in China, so as a Chinese national, she studied Americans in their Professional Habitat. I always wondered how that bypassed US Immigration, it was a very lax time in terms of teaching Chinese Nationals how to do things. Last I heard from her, they were carrying on the research I was doing into the Discrete Mathematics of Waveform Analysis for Human Breathing. A worthy subject of study. Probably using ML techniques to identify breathing patterns.</p>
