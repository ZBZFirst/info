# What is Minute Ventilation?

<p>This short guide explains what Minute Ventilation is for Healthcare Providers. It is one of the most useful equations that a provider can demonstrate proficiency in due to its usage in numerous other healthcare equations. One way to demonstrate proficiency is by performing the calculation a few times. Read the following guide and then attempt the quiz found in the link below.</p>

    <h2>Graphing the Results for Classification</h2>
    <p>Performing the equation with different input parameters gives different Minute Ventilation results. Applying a coloring scheme based on Minute Ventilation Values allows for the creations of a color classification scheme based on conditional statements about the values produced.</p>

    <h2>Large Dataset Classified</h2>
    <p>Input parameters are fixed so a narrow range of values can be expected, graphing 100+ values allows for dataset creation that more easily allows for inspecting potential spatial properties in the dataset.</p>
