# What is Minute Ventilation?

<p>This short guide explains what Minute Ventilation is for Healthcare Providers. It is one of the most useful equations that a provider can demonstrate proficiency in due to its usage in numerous other healthcare equations. One way to demonstrate proficiency is by performing the calculation a few times. Read the following guide and then attempt the quiz found in the link below. If you want a certificate of some kind, go get the codes, they are free but you have to change the price to free and fill out the form.</p>

    <h2>Graphing the Results for Classification</h2>
    <p>Performing the equation with different input parameters gives different Minute Ventilation results. Applying a coloring scheme based on Minute Ventilation Values allows for the creations of a color classification scheme based on conditional statements about the values produced. The same color scheme is used in the next video.</p>

    <h2>Large Dataset Visualization</h2>
    <p>Since the input parameters are constrained to a narrow range, a full set of values can be graphed and plotted, graphing 100+ values with conditional formatting allows for a dataset to be visualized that more easily allows for analysis.</p>
