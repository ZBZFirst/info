Abstract If Available: Mechanical ventilation with high tidal Volumes (V-T) has been shown to induce lung injury. We examined the hypothesis that this procedure induces lung injury with inflammatory features. Anesthetized male Wistar rats were randomized into three groups: group 1 (N &#x3D; 12): V-T &#x3D; 7 ml/kg, respiratory rate (RR) &#x3D; 50 breaths/min; group 2 (N &#x3D; 10): V-T &#x3D; 21 ml/kg, RR &#x3D; 16 breaths/min; group 3 (N &#x3D; 11): V-T &#x3D; 42 ml/kg, RR &#x3D; 8 breaths/min, The animals were ventilated with fraction of inspired oxygen of I and positive end-expiratory pressure of 2 cmH(2)O. After 4 h of ventilation, group 3, compared to groups 1 and 2, had lower PaO2 [280 (range 73-458) vs 517 (range 307-596), and 547 mmHg (range 330-662), respectively, P &lt; 0.05], higher wet lung weight [3.62 &amp;PLUSMN; 0.91 vs 1.69 &amp;PLUSMN; 0.48 and 1.44 &amp;PLUSMN; 0.20 g, respectively, P &lt; 0.05], and higher wet lung weight/dry lung weight ratio [18.14 (range 11.55-26.31) vs 7.80 (range 4.79-12.18), and 6.34 (range 5.92-7.04), respectively, P &lt; 0.05]. Total cell and neutrophil counts were higher in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2 (P &lt; 0.05), as were baseline TNF-alpha concentrations [134 (range &lt;10-386) vs 16 (range &lt;10-24), and 17 pg/ml (range &lt;10-23), respectively, P &lt; 0.05]. Serum TNF-alpha concentrations reached a higher level in group 3, but without statistical significance. These results suggest that mechanical ventilation with high V-T induces lung injury with inflammatory characteristics. This ventilatory strategy can affect the release of TNF-alpha in the lungs and can reach the systemic circulation, a finding that may have relevance for the development of a systemic inflammatory response.
