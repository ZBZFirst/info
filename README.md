As a generality, if you want to use this to teach, go ahead. However, YOU cannot charge when using it to teach without permission. That means you cannot use any of the material to quiz or test someone if you are charging them anything.

If you charge money and use this to teach or validate someones performance, you must give me a percentage of the revenue from using these items. The cost is 50% of what you charge someone BEFORE coupons or any service to make the price reduced. 

FINDERS FEE:
if someone charges you to use the items on this page and they do not have permission from me, you will recive 50% of any money i am able to collect as a finders fee if you notify me and I am able to sue them successfully. Just open a ticket on the Issues section.

TLDR: dont use my shit to sell stuff or make money without including me.
