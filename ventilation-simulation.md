## About This Simulation

This interactive simulation helps you practice calculating initial ventilator settings for adult patients based on NBRC guidelines for lung-protective ventilation.

### Learning Objectives:
- Apply Ideal Body Weight (IBW) formulas based on patient gender and height
- Calculate appropriate tidal volume ranges (6-8 mL/kg IBW)
- Make clinical decisions based on patient conditions
- Reinforce NBRC guidelines for mechanical ventilation

### How to Use:
1. A random patient scenario will be generated automatically
2. Complete each calculation step by entering your answers
3. Click "Check All Answers" to get immediate feedback
4. Use "Show Solutions" if you need help
5. Generate new scenarios for unlimited practice
