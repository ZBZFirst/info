    <p>These projects represent different pursuits of knowledge, curiosity, and application of real tools to show others what we have.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Project 1: Capturing the Human Breath or Lerping It</h3>
            <p>A deep dive into visualizing a value that oscillates between 0 to 1 utilizing Python or Hardware Capture devices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Project 2: Data Mapping the Raw Output</h3>
            <p>Different machines report in different ways, here, we learn how to map values from one measurement to another.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Project 3: Visualization of Human Breathing, Complex Analyses for Simple Processes</h3>
            <p>A deep dive into visualizing a value interpolating between 0 to 1 utilizing Python</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Project 4: The Why? Comparing Datasets for Future Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <p>A simple comparison between data sets allows for reinforcing what worked..</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Project 5: Vibecoding explained and its application in the data analysis framework.</h3>
            <p>Introduction of a specific data prompt technique to improve the input process for solving problems through Large Language Models.</p>
        </li>
