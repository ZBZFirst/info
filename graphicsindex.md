A Fast Fourier Transofmration Visualizer
[View the FFT Audio Visualizer](/info/FFT.html)
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a process where signals are converted from a time series format to a spectral format. It is a very time worthy subject to study due to its nature of isolating components of signals over time. The true usage of an FFT for healthcare purposes is elusive but I have found several interesting ways to start approaching it. I will write about these methods in time. Initial research was under duress and highly experimental conditions. 

For now, the usage of this FFT Visualizer is limited to your microphone. Upon giving permission to access the microphone, the javascript on the page will perform the FFT on it and split it into bins so you can easily identify "bass sounds" vs. "treble sounds". The amount of detail can be increased through increasing the "bin" slider. This adds more bars to the screen to visualize more detail, but at the cost of additional computing power.

For those particularly interested, I added custom values for each specific bin and left them numbered on the X Axis. You can set the ranges of Bin 1 to be independent of the rest of the graph. I believe some interesting effects can be elucidated visually by changing the bin values in a custom format.

Anyway, have fun with it.
